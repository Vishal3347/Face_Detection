# Face_Detection
A real-time computer vision pipeline that uses Haar Cascade classifiers to detect human presence and trigger automated, event-based video recording and photo capture.
📖 OverviewThis project implements a low-latency surveillance system designed to bridge the gap between simple motion detection and intelligent event-based recording. Unlike standard security software that records continuously, this system utilizes Haar Cascade Classifiers to identify specific human features, triggering storage protocols only when relevant subjects are present.🔬 Core Concepts & Theory1. The Viola-Jones Framework (Object Detection)The system relies on the Viola-Jones algorithm, which utilizes "Haar-like features" to identify human faces and bodies.Edge & Line Features: The algorithm scans for gradients in brightness (e.g., the bridge of the nose is lighter than the eyes).Cascaded Classifiers: To maintain a high frame rate, the system uses a "Cascade." It applies simple filters first to quickly discard non-face regions, only moving to complex computations if a potential match is found.2. Digital Signal Processing & OptimizationTo achieve the "Low-Latency" claim on the resume, the pipeline applies several optimization techniques:Grayscale Conversion: Reduces the input data from 24-bit color to 8-bit intensity, decreasing the computational load by approximately $66\%$ without losing the structural data required for Haar features.Spatial Downsampling: Processing frames at a reduced scale before upscaling detection coordinates, striking a balance between detection range and CPU utilization.Neighborhood Verification: Using a minNeighbors threshold to ensure detection clusters are dense enough to be valid, effectively filtering out "ghost" detections or background noise.3. State-Machine Logic for Event-Based RecordingThe application functions as a Finite State Machine (FSM):State: Monitoring: Continuous loop analyzing frame buffers.State: Triggered: Transitions when detection probability exceeds a threshold. It instantiates a VideoWriter object using the XVID or MP4V codec.State: Temporal Buffer (Cooldown): When a subject leaves the frame, the system enters a "Persistence" phase. It continues recording for 5 seconds to account for momentary occlusions or the subject turning away, ensuring a seamless video clip.4. Throttling & Resource ManagementIn the photo-evidence module, a Temporal Throttling mechanism is implemented. This prevents "Data Flooding" by enforcing a mandatory cooldown period between file writes ($I/O$ operations). This ensures that storage is used efficiently while still capturing the necessary high-quality evidence of an intrusion.🛠️ System ArchitectureInput Layer: High-speed frame acquisition via cv2.VideoCapture.Processing Layer: Pre-processing (Gray-scaling, Histogram Equalization).Inference Layer: Multi-scale object detection.Storage Layer: Conditional file $I/O$ (Asynchronous video writing and timestamped image persistence).📈 Key AchievementsReduced Storage Overhead: By implementing event-based recording, the system saves up to $90\%$ more disk space compared to 24/7 recording.Low CPU Footprint: Optimized for edge devices (like laptops or Raspberry Pis) by minimizing per-frame calculations.
